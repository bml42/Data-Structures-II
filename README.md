# Data-Structures-II
C projects expanding on the information taught in DSA1.
<br></br>Project 1 is a simulated shell script that will allow users to perform basic actions that would be available through use of a shell: add file/directory, rm file/directory, cd/.. <directory>, pwd, find file/directory.
<br></br>Project 2 handles events passed through a priority queue and a heap and then calculates process time with both simulated data as well as times calculated by the event handler.   
<br></br>Project 3 deals with combinatorial optimization by attempting to answer the Travelling Salesman Problem.  It calculates the shortest length path across the weighted edges of n nodes, calculates the efficiency of the path, and then uses genetic programming in an attempt to find the most efficient path.
<br></br>Project 4
