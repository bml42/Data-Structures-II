# Data-Structures-II
C projects expanding on the information taught in DSA1.
<br></br>Project 1 is a simulated shell script that will allow users to perform basic actions that would be available through use of a shell: add file/directory, rm file/directory, cd/.. <directory>, pwd, find file/directory.
<br></br>Project 2 handles events passed through a priority queue and a heap and then calculates process time with both simulated data as well as times calculated by the event handler.   
<br></br>Project 3 deals with combinatorial optimization by attempting to answer the Travelling Salesman Problem.  It calculates the shortest length path across the weighted edges of n nodes, calculates the efficiency of the path, and then uses genetic programming in an attempt to find the most efficient path.
<br></br>Project 4 evaluates randomly generated datasets to simulate the creation of "good" and "bad" parts. It calculates the probability distribution and cumulative probability distribution of the data and compares it to simulated data to determine the efficiency of the method for checking the qualitiy of parts.
<br></br>Project 5 determines the length and value of the least common subsequence of any given two strings via the traceback approach.
